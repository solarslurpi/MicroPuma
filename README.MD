# What the Heck?
I am exploring how good of a microscope can be made using mostly 3D parts.  Heck, it works for my Prusa Printer....Oh and, of course learning for the sheer exhilaration of it all.
# Welcome
Who needs Virtual Reality when there is a whole world of tiny creatures dashing around a soil sample.  I wanted a microscope that I could evolve over time to self adjust focus, detect movement and track the little critters as they dash about,..., all digitally captured.  I ran across [the PUMA project](https://www.optarc.co.uk/products/puma-products/) by Dr. Paul J. Tadross and decided to try putting together the PUMA DIY microscope.  A person with expertese in microscopy has the passion to open source a DIY microscope and also make a small business out of it. On to answer the burning questions -  _how hard can it be to make a Puma microscope?_  I guess _as hard as I make it_. So off I go!

The guide walks through how to use FreeCAD to generate the STL files.  The information helped to get into FreeCAD's "mesh design workspace", however, I was having a challenge saving to STL. I found [export method 1 from the FreeCAD wiki](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Export_to_STL_or_OBJ) gave me the info I needed.  The guide lists all the STL files.  
# First Build
This build consists of:
- building the stand.
- building the Foundational scope.

As I dove in, I immediately started drowning in the trees without a way of seeing the forest.  
- Pages upon pages of CAD parts.  
- A CAD software package I'd never heard of (my bad I guess).  
- Component sources are places I don't normally shop (Alibaba for example).  M6, M4, M3, M2 threaded bolts, nuts, washers with specific tops...um, my hardware store might have had one of the bolts....
# Building the Stand
I couldn't find any manual or video that walks through putting the stage together.  Here is my attempt.  I broke building the stand into three parts.
